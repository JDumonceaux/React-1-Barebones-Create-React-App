# React-1-Barebones-Create-React-App
A barebone React app created using npx create-react-app my-app

CRA (Create React App) has, for a long time, been used as an easy starting point for quickly creating the basic structure of an React application.

As of March 16, 2023, the React Development Team https://react.dev/ no longer recommends CRA.

Alternatives (as of 11/2023)
- Vite + React
- Next.js
- T3 Stack
- Remix
- Gatsby
- Expo 


After installing npm and git, at a terminal type (replacing "my-app" with your app name):

npx create-react-app my-app

To start the app:

Run npm start
